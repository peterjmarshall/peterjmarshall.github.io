                <p>
                    My research investigates the development of neural body representations and their 
                    role in social cognition across the lifespan. Using EEG and other neuroscience methods, 
                    my lab examines how the brain comes to represent both our own bodies and those of others, 
                    particularly during infancy and early childhood.
                    
                    This work connects to fundamental questions about embodied cognition - how our physical 
                    experiences shape the way we think and learn. Recently, my research has expanded in two 
                    key directions: studying human-robot interaction through the lens of embodiment, with a 
                    focus on how children perceive and engage with social robots; and developing theoretical 
                    frameworks that can help advance a more biologically coherent understanding of brain development.
                    
                    This integrative approach brings together insights from developmental science, neuroscience, 
                    and embodied cognition to better understand how humans develop the ability to connect with 
                    others through shared bodily experiences. My work has been funded by major 
                    grants from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, and the James S. 
                    McDonnell Foundation.

                                This collection of interconnected essays explores fundamental questions 
                                about development, form, and change across biological and psychological domains. 
                                The materials examine how individual development occurs within broader patterns 
                                of life cycles and evolution, drawing on insights from developmental systems theory, 
                                evolutionary developmental biology, and cultural-biological approaches.
                                
                                Key themes include the relationship between form and matter, the nature of pattern 
                                explanation, and how stable developmental trajectories emerge without rigid predetermination. 
                                The resources challenge conventional genetic determinism while offering new ways to 
                                understand the reliability of developmental processes.
                                
                                Written to be accessible yet rigorous, these materials provide an integrated framework 
                                for understanding development that bridges multiple explanatory frames - from immediate 
                                mechanisms to evolutionary time scales. The collection serves as both an introduction 
                                to developmental thinking and a deeper exploration of how forms emerge and persist in 
                                living systems.

                                These educational materials explore how living things create meaning through their 
                                active engagement with the world. Drawing from research across biology, cognitive science, 
                                and philosophy, the resources examine how different organisms - from bacteria to humans - 
                                bring forth their own unique perspectives and ways of being.
                                
                                Rather than passive information processors, living things actively construct their 
                                realities through their embodied activities and interactions with their environments. 
                                The materials cover key concepts like autopoiesis (self-creation), umwelt (self-world), 
                                structural coupling between organisms and environments, and the deep connections between 
                                biological and cultural evolution.
                                
                                Written for a broad audience, these resources aim to illuminate the profound ways that 
                                life shapes experience and meaning-making across multiple scales - from the cellular 
                                to the social. The goal is to help readers appreciate both the diversity of lived 
                                perspectives in nature and the common patterns that unite all living things as meaning-makers.

                                This open educational resource explores fundamental questions about human development 
                                through an integrative lens that connects evolutionary, developmental, and cultural 
                                perspectives. The materials examine how brains, bodies, and minds develop in the 
                                context of human experience, moving beyond simple nature-versus-nurture debates to 
                                understand development as a dynamic process.
                                
                                Key themes include the embodied nature of cognition, the role of social interaction 
                                in human development, the cultural-biological nature of human experience, and how 
                                developmental systems theory helps us understand both stability and change across 
                                the lifespan.
