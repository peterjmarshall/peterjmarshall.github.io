            <p> </p>
            <p> My current position is Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Temple University in Philadelphia (USA). For my official university page <a href="https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/marshall-peter-j">click here</a>,

            <p> I have been Chair of the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Temple since 2016. I am currently President of the Society for the Study of Human Development.

              <p>What does it mean to be a living, thinking being? As a psychology researcher with a background in biology, I can see that traditional approaches often miss something fundamental about the nature of life and mind. This question is becomes more relevant as we see how artificial intelligence tools are advancing. While AI can process information with remarkable sophistication, living intelligence emerges from fundamentally different principles. One area where we lack sophistication is in understanding the biological foundations of development. We often talk about genes as if they contain instructions for building an organism – but this is not actually very helpful for understanding how development proceeds. The whole picture certainly involves genes, but it also involves cellular processes, environmental conditions, and the activity of the developing organism</p>
              <p>We can also lose sight of the fact that rather than simply responding to environmental inputs or following programmed routines, living systems actively generate meaning through their own organization and activity. Our minds emerge from this fundamental property of life, elaborated through the unique ways humans participate in cultural practices. Students often learn outdated models that don't capture the dynamic, self-organizing nature of living systems. By bringing together current understanding from psychology, biology, and neuroscience, we can build a more coherent picture of how minds develop and function. I'm particularly interested in how we can better integrate these wider notions into how we study human development. This also means appreciating how human psychological capacities emerge through the interweaving of biological and cultural processes</p>
              <p>In my opinion, there is a need for educational resources that bridge disciplines and help students see the wider picture of what they are learning. We need a perspective offers new ways to understand both the continuity between humans and other living systems, and the unique characteristics of human experience. As a start on all of this, I developed the resources outlined below – all of which are still works in progress. &nbsp;</p>

                        I wrote these documents to help students and other readers understand development from multiple angles - from the big picture of how life cycles have evolved to the details of how individual organisms develop and change. My goal was to explore fundamental questions about what development means by connecting ideas across biology, psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy.&nbsp; </div>

                      This resource emerged from my interest in what makes living things fundamentally different from non-living things. These materials examine this question through the lens of embodiment, and more specifically an enactivist line of thinking. Psychology students rarely encounter these fundamental ideas about the nature of living things, even though they offer profound insights into cognition, development, and the relation between individual and environment.&nbsp; </div>

                      These learning materials discuss&nbsp; how humans came to occupy such a distinctive place in life on earth, looking beyond simple biological explanations to examine the complex relationships between development, learning, and culture. The documents explore how human abilities emerged through the interplay between our extended childhood, our capacity to learn from others, and our drive to share and improve knowledge across generations.&nbsp; </div>
